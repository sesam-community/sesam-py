# Sesam Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sesam-community/sesam-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sesam-community/sesam-py)

Sesam command tool to use with [Sesam](https://sesam.io).

## Installing

Obtain the latest binaries for your OS from [Github Releases](https://github.com/sesam-community/sesam-py/releases/), unpack and make sure it is accessible in your "PATH". Create optional configuration files as described below.

Verify your installation by running `sesam -version` command.

If you want to run from the source or build locally:
To install and run the sesam client with python on Linux/OSX (python 3.5+ required):
```
$ cd sesam
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python sesam.py -version
sesam version 1.0.0
```

To create a sesam client binary with pyinstaller on Linux/OSX (python 3.5+ required):
```
$ cd sesam
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pyinstaller --onefile sesam.py
$Â dist/sesam -version
sesam version 2.0.0
```

## Configuring

#### 1- syncconfig
Sesam client needs the node to operate on and jwt to authenticate. 'NODE' and 'JWT' can be specified in 3 ways: environment variables, command line args or syncconfig file.
To specify via syncconfig file create a file named `.syncconfig` in the your repos top directory, paste and edit the following:
```
#why not specify the subscription name here as comment to avoid confusions?
NODE="<sesam node name for instance 'datahub-asdfasdf.sesam.cloud'>"
JWT="<jwt to authenticate against node>"
```

P.S. Optionally, you can use another filename and location, and then specify it as a command line argument.

#### 2- sesamconfig

Sesam client can read an optional sesamconfig file to change the default behaviour. To utilize sesamconfig create `.sesamconfig.json` in the your repos top directory, paste `{}` and add item(s) among the followings:

* **formatstyle** : add and customize following item to customize formatting. The options here correspond to 'Editor Options' on pipe/system configuration page in the sesam portal. It is sufficient to specify the non-default items only.
```json
  "formatstyle": {
    "spaces_for_indent": 2,
    "use_tab_for_indent": false,
    "space_after_colon": true,
    "space_after_comma": true,
    "new_line_before_dict_as_value": false,
    "newline_before_dict_in_array": false,
    "close_nested_array_on_new_line": true,
    "collapse_indent_for_dict_inside_array": true,
    "elements_of_array_as_value_on_separate_lines": true
  }
```
P.S. Optionally, you can use another filename and location, and then specify it as a command line argument.


#### An example sesamconfig file content:
```json
{
  "formatstyle": {
    "spaces_for_indent": 4,
    "elements_of_array_as_value_on_separate_lines": true
  }
}
```

## Configuring tests

| Property | Description | Type | Required | Default |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _id | Name of the test. | string | No | Name of the .test.json file |
| type | Config type so that this later can just be part of the rest of the config. | String | No | test |
| description | A description of the test. | string | No | |
| ignore | If the output should be ignored during tests. | boolean | No | ``false`` |
| endpoint | If the output should be fetched from a published endpoint instead. | string | No | By default the json is grabbed from ``/pipes/<my-pipe>/entities``
| stage | In which pipe stage to get the entities (source/before-transform/after-transform/sink) | string | No | By default the stage is ``sink``
| file | File that contains the expected results. | string | No | Name of the .test.json file without .test (e.g. foo.test.json looks for foo.json)
| pipe | Pipe that contains the output to test. | string | No | Same as above |
| blacklist | Properties to ignore in the output. | Array of strings | No | ``[]`` |
| parameters | Which parameters to pass as bound parameters. Note that parameters only works for published endpoints. | Object | No | ``{}`` |


Example:
```
$ cat foo.test.json
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "type": "test",
  "file": "foo.json"
  "blacklist": ["my-last-updated-ts"],
  "ignore": false
}
```

### DTL parameters

If you need to pass various variations of bound parameters to the DTL, you just create multiple .test.json files for each combination of parameters.

Example:
```
$ cat foo-A.test.json
{
  "pipe": "foo",
  "file": "foo-A.xml",
  "endpoint": "xml",
  "parameters": {
    "my-param": "A"
  }
}
$ cat foo-B.test.json
{
  "pipe": "foo",
  "file": "foo-B.xml",
  "endpoint": "xml",
  "parameters": {
    "my-param": "B"
  }
}
```
This will compare the output of ``/publishers/foo/xml?my-param=A`` with the contents of ``foo-A.xml`` and ``/publishers/foo/xml?my-param=B`` with the contents of ``foo-B.xml``.

### Internal properties

All internal properties except ``_id`` and ``_deleted`` are removed from the output. Entities that has ``_deleted`` set to ``false`` will also be removed.

### Endpoints

By default the entities are fetched from ``/pipes/<my-pipe>/entities``, but if endpoint is set it will be fetched from
``/publishers/<my-pipe>/<endpoint-type>`` based on the endpoint type specified. Note that the pipe needs to be configured to publish to this endpoint.

Example:
```
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "type": "test",
  "endpoint": "xml",
  "file": "foo.xml"
}
```
This will compare the output of ``/publishers/foo/xml`` with the contents of ``foo.xml``.


Example:
```
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "type": "test",
  "endpoint": "json",
  "stage": "source"
}
```
This will compare the output of ``/pipes/foo/entities?stage=source`` with the contents of ``foo.json``, useful
when the pipe's sink strips away the "_id" property for example.


### Blacklisting

If the data contains values that are not deterministic (e.g. timestamp added during the run) they can be filtered out using the blacklist.

Example:
```
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "type": "test",
  "blacklist": ["foo", "ns1:bar"]
}
```

This will filter out properties called ``foo`` and ``ns1:bar`` (namespaced).

If the data is not located at the top level, a dotted notation is supported ``foo.bar``. This will remove the ``bar`` property from the object (or list of objects) located under the ``foo`` property. If you need to blacklist a property that actually contains a dot, the dot can be escaped like this ``foo\.bar``

If you need to ignore a property on a list of objects, you can also use this notation ``foos.*.bar``. This will remove the ``bar`` property from all the objects located under ``foos``.

Example:
```
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "foos": {
    "A": {
      "bar": "baz",
      "foobar": "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

Will end up as the following (with ``"blacklist": ["foos.*.bar"]``):
```
{
  "_id": "foo",
  "foos": {
    "A": {
      "foobar": "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

### Avoid ignore and blacklist

It is recommended to avoid ignoring or blacklisting as much as possible as this creates a false sense of correctness. Tests will pass, but deviations are silently ignored. A better solution is to avoid these properties in the output if possible.

### Uploading test data
There is a `sesam convert` command which takes all the pipes with conditional embedded sources, and modifies the case alternative which corresponds to the current profile env (usually "test") so that it is not an embedded source, but rather an http_endpoint source. At the same time, it takes the entities found in the original embedded source and stores them in separate files under a new `testdata` directory. This command should be necessary to run only once. It can take a `-dump` option that will first backup the entire config into a zip file.

When doing `sesam upload` or `sesam test`, the CLI will also upload testdata to any input pipes based on what it finds in a folder called `testdata`.

### Using Profiles
A profile file is a json file with the variables list as its content. The name has to follow "<profile>-env.json" convention.

Profile files are applicable to `upload`, `download`, `status` commands.

Default profile is 'test', thus, 'test-env.json' is the default profile file. It is expected to be at the same directory as the sesam CLI is executed from.
To use any other profile, create a profile file and use `-profile` argument.

e.g. Given that profile `profiles/prod-env.json` file exists, one can
  * upload with `sesam upload -profile profiles/prod`
  * download with `sesam download -profile profiles/prod`
  * see status with `sesam status -profile profiles/prod`
